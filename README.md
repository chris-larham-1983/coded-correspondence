# coded-correspondence

This is my solution to the **Codecademy Learn Python 3** off-platform project, *Coded Correspondence*.  In this project, I had to write functions to encode and decode messages in accordance with both the Caesar cipher and the Vigen√®re cipher cryptographic encryption techniques.  

This project was a lot of fun, and helped me practise my skills in the following areas:

- Python functions
- Python lists
- Python strings
- Python maths
- Working with *Jupyter Notebook*
